# üìä E-Commerce Tax Automation Tool (Excel VBA)

## 1. Introduction  
E-commerce in the Philippines has grown rapidly over the past decade, led by major platforms like Shopee, Lazada, and TikTok Shop. In 2024, the government introduced a mandatory tax on e-commerce businesses to boost revenue and regulate the fast-expanding digital market. This project supports that transition by helping sellers streamline their compliance processes.

This Excel-based tool uses **VBA macros** to automate the consolidation of sales data and generation of sales invoices, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors in tax reporting.

## 2. Description of Project  
This project is an Excel macro automation tool tailored for Philippine e-commerce sellers. It consolidates raw sales data from Shopee, Lazada, and TikTok Shop, matches these with official invoice numbers, and helps automate tax calculations.

### üîí Business Rules / Tax Compliance
- Orders **below PHP 500** (per order, per day) are grouped into a **single invoice**.
- Orders **exceeding PHP 500** require **separate invoices**.
- Aligns with BIR tax rules and ensures proper invoice issuance and record-keeping.

The main goal of this tool is to simplify tax-related workflows for online sellers by:
- Improving accuracy in tax reporting  
- Consolidating multi-platform sales  
- Reducing manual data entry  
- Matching with official printed invoice numbers  
- Supporting daily, weekly, or monthly reporting

## 5. Methodology

### üì• Data Extraction

  - Remove unnecessary columns
  - Normalize formats
  - Filter out non-sales data

### ü§ñ Automation with VBA
- VBA macros consolidate orders based on business rules
- Orders below PHP 500 are grouped under a single invoice
- Orders above PHP 500 are assigned individual invoices
- Invoice numbers are automatically assigned

## 7. Summary of VBA Logic

### üß† Core Logic
1. **Setup** ‚Äì Assign worksheet references and clear old data

- Conditional logic for tax grouping
- Excel's built-in sorting methods
- Automated invoice generation and grouping logic
